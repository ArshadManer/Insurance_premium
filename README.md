# Insurance Premium Prediction

## Introduction

This project aims to predict the insurance premium for a policyholder based on various factors such as age, gender, smoking habit, etc. The model is trained on a dataset of policyholder information and premium amounts.

## Requirements

The following packages are required to run the code:

- NumPy
- Pandas
- Scikit-learn
- Matplotlib (optional, for visualizing results)

## Setup

To set up the environment, you need to install the required packages. You can use the following command to install them using `pip`: pip install numpy pandas scikit-learn matplotlib


## Usage

The code is written in Python and can be executed using a Jupyter Notebook or any other Python environment.

The dataset used for training and testing the model is included in the `data` folder. To train the model, simply run the cells in the Jupyter Notebook or execute the script `run.py`.

## File Directory

- `insurance_premium_prediction.py`: The main script that trains the model and predicts insurance premiums.
- `data`: The folder containing the dataset used for training and testing the model.
- `models`: The folder to save the trained model (optional).
- `results`: The folder to save the results of the model (optional).

## Model

The model used in this project is a simple linear regression model. However, you can experiment with other regression algorithms or try to improve the performance of the model by fine-tuning the hyperparameters or using a more complex model.

## Results

The performance of the model is evaluated using mean squared error (MSE) and R-squared (R^2) metrics. The results show that the model is able to make accurate predictions with a low MSE and a high R^2 value.

## Conclusion

This project provides a basic implementation of an insurance premium prediction model. The code and methodology can be used as a starting point for building more advanced models or for exploring different regression algorithms.
